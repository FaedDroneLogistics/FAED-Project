/**
 * This package contains support for Java projects.
 *
 * <p>
 * One important concept for Java projects that require support in the workbench is the container.
 * This is the environment that activities and libraries live in. Libraries will often have classes
 * they want to export to the outside world and classes they want to keep private. They may also have
 * to some initialization when they first appear in the container and when they are removed.
