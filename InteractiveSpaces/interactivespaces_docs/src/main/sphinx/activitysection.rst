Activities are the workhorse of your Interactive Space. Any functionality that you
want is implemented as an Activity.

Activities can be as simple as a few lines in a configuration file
or as complicated as a full set of Java classes. Don't worry if you
don't know Java, you can also write Live Activities in a variety of
scripting languages. :doc:`Activity Types <activitytypes>` allow you to chose what kind of 
Activity you will implement.

:doc:`Basic Activity Functionality <activitybasicfunctionality>` is what
functionality you will find, no matter what kind of Activity is 
implemented.

:doc:`Supported Activity Classes <activitysupportedclasses>` let you 
easily write Activities
by just supplying a new methods that supply the needed functionality.

:doc:`Activity Configurations <activityconfigurations>` let you take
Activities and configure them for their exact use in a particular
instance.

:doc:`Basic Activity Communications <activitybasiccommunications>` allow
Activities to communicate events and other information to each other.

:doc:`Activity Components <activitycomponents>` let you easily add additional functionality to 
Supported Activity Classes.

There is a lot of information in the next few chapters because there is 
a lot to Activities.
