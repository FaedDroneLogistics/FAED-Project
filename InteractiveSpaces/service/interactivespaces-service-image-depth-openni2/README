The code in this bundle provides access to the OpenNI2 and NiTE2 C APIs.

Interestingly the C++ API is build fully on the C APIs using .h files that define the needed class code.

This command runs the jnaerator package, available at https://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/

This tool reads the library's .h files and writes Java code which represents the library. The 
openni.jnaerator file describes how the code should be generated. In the current case, code is generated
which uses the BridJ library, which can call code in a native library dynamically without generating any
JNI code.
