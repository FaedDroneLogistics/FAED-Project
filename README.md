# FAED-Project

The main idea of this project is to use a drone to bring flying an automated electronic defibrillator (AED) where a cardiac emergency is happening. This drone will have a support platform with an easy extraction system in order to get the AED as fast as possible.
But sideways the project is the base block for any kind of drone based distribution project.

The web site was created to highlight our ideas and promotion:

COLLABORATIONS

The idea is link those organizations, each one giving different kind of support to develop the project.

###Lleida Drone
Lleida Drone Is the first Drone association ever created in Spain back in 2011. With a deep recognizement among the industry, due to our Professional and Amateur drone conferences handled two times every year with thousands of attendees and also some projects born inhouse, such as this FAED Drone project.

###Neosalus Solutions
This is our partner from the AED industry. With thousands of deployed AEDs, has the knowledge of the medical and practical issues of the project. Eradicated also in the Science Park of Lleida. 

###OSRF FAED subproject

The idea for a OSRF collaboration can be in two areas:

- With the OSRF/Erle Robotics + announcement of Victor Mayoral of v1 of his autopilot, the doors are open to a truly interaction between a drone based on a linux autopilot and the FAED platform. The two key basic points are direct programming of the drone routes, and basic real time info about the drone situation through radio downlink. 

- Handling the linking of all the real hardware needed, such as meteo stations, hangars, all of this using ROS and the other platform we use from Google, that’s Interactive Spaces, that actually integrates ROS for hardware drivers.


###ERLE Robotics
Hardware (autopilots), mentorship and guidance on the project.

###Liquid Galaxy LAB
The Liquid Galaxy LAB is a space we have at the Science Park of Lleida where we develop our GSOC and other projects, such as Lleida Drone association, who is based here.

###Liquid Galaxy FAED subproject
The Liquid Galaxy project will be in charge of the visualization, as seen in the basic slides, importing of the data from different places, formatting them specially for representation on the Liquid Galaxy in almost real time.

###Google Interactive Spaces (IS) FAED subproject 
We’re in conversations with IS creators and GSOC representatives to have IS as GSOC 2015 new project on Google’s GSOC. This will not be sure until 2015 projects are announced at the beginning of march 2015. The intention is to draw some of the slots to FAED.

###Google Physical web collaboration
We plan to use Google’s Physical Web technology, where a BLE beacon will be installed on every drone, that will be his virtual license plate. Those PW beacon radiate through Bluetooth 4.0 an URL, that will point to a simple mobile web page with all the data identification of the drone plus information of the actual trip, Drone port, Drop point, emergency serial tracker, etc

###Open Source
The project will be open sourced under a OSI license to be choosed.
This will foster a community, open the doors for future common projects, and have a real deal of get people collaborate on it.
