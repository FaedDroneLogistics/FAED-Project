Prerequirements:
In order to compile xiv, you need the following elements:
  - libjpeg-devel
  - libtiff-devel
  - libexif-devel
  - libx11-devel

Optionally you need zenity or kdialog in order to be able to launch
xiv.sh without any file (from a menu for instance) and ImageMagick to
convert unsupported image formats.
