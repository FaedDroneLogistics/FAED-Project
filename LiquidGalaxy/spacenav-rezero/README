This app sends a feature report to the Space Navigator causing it to rezero.
This implementation uses the freeware hidapi library to interface the hidraw
API provided by the linux kernel.  Since the hidapi library is portable to
Windows and OS X, it should be simple to port this app if desired.

One caveat of using the hidraw API is that feature reports are not supported
in kernels prior to 2.6.39 (according to the hidapi docs).  The libusb backend
is also provided by hidapi, but it didn't work in my testing (it disabled my
SpaceNav until I replugged it).
